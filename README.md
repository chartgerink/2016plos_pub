# Research project on publishing in the PLOS family of journals

PLOS provides an API to access information from publications. In this project, I will investigate multiple aspects. I have previously looked into a few things relating to [publication delays](https://github.com/chartgerink/2015lag), from which I will import a reasonable amount of code. I also wrote some code in another project [to investigate ghost authors](https://github.com/chartgerink/2016copilot2/blob/master/functions/download_extract_data_api.R) which I will reuse here.
